# 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory analysis was performed to understand dataset structure and identify patterns affecting **sales performance and delivery efficiency**.

### Key Analyses

- Sales Distribution
- Monthly Sales Trends
- Late Delivery by Shipping Mode
- Late Delivery by Region
- Profit vs Discount Analysis
- Top Products by Sales

EDA helps uncover **business insights and operational bottlenecks** in the supply chain.

---

# 📊 Statistical Analysis

Statistical tests were conducted to validate relationships between supply chain variables.

### Hypothesis Testing

| Hypothesis | Test Used | Purpose |
|------------|-----------|--------|
| Shipping Mode vs Delivery Delay | ANOVA | Evaluate logistics performance |
| Customer Segment vs Sales | ANOVA | Compare purchasing behavior |
| Product Category vs Late Delivery Risk | Chi-Square | Identify category-level risks |
| Seasonal Demand | ANOVA | Detect monthly demand variation |
| Shipping Delay vs Sales Trend | Granger Causality | Evaluate temporal impact |

---

### Weekend vs Weekday Sales

A **t-test** was used to determine whether sales differ between weekends and weekdays.

- **p < 0.05** → Significant difference  
- **p > 0.05** → No significant difference

---

### Correlation Analysis

A correlation matrix was used to examine relationships among numerical variables such as:

- Sales
- Order Quantity
- Profit Margin
- Shipping Delay

---

# ⏱ Granger Causality Test

The Granger causality test evaluated whether **shipping delays influence sales trends over time**.

Results show **no significant causality**, indicating that sales trends are primarily influenced by **demand patterns, pricing strategies, and seasonal factors rather than delivery delays**.

---

# 🤖 Machine Learning Models

Two classification models were implemented to predict **late delivery risk**:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest

Random Forest demonstrated **better predictive performance** in identifying late deliveries.

---

# 📉 Regression & Forecasting Models

Several regression models were used to predict sales performance:

- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression (reduces overfitting)
- Lasso Regression (performs feature selection)

Models were evaluated using:

- RMSE
- MAE
- R² Score
- 5-fold Cross Validation

---

# ⏳ ARIMA Time Series Forecasting

An **ARIMA(1,1,1)** model was implemented to forecast future sales trends.

Key observation:

- The **Moving Average (MA) component is statistically significant**, suggesting that short-term demand fluctuations influence sales more than long-term trends.

ARIMA effectively captures **temporal demand patterns in supply chain data**.

---

# 🧪 Model Evaluation

Regression models produced **similar performance results**, with low R² values (~0.03), indicating that simple linear models capture only a small portion of sales variation.

Therefore, **time-series forecasting provides better insights for demand prediction**.

---

# 🏆 Model Selection

The **ARIMA forecasting model** was selected because it captures **temporal demand patterns that regression models cannot fully explain**.

This model supports:

- Demand forecasting
- Inventory planning
- Supply chain optimization

---

# 🔍 Feature Importance Analysis

Feature importance was analyzed using:

- Pearson Correlation
- Spearman Correlation
- Mutual Information
- SHAP values

### Key Findings

- **Order item quantity** has the strongest relationship with sales
- **Profit margin** contributes through non-linear relationships
- **Order month** reflects seasonal demand patterns
- **Shipping delay** and weekend indicators have minimal impact on sales prediction

These insights highlight that **product demand and pricing factors drive sales performance**.

---

# ⚠️ Business Risk Assessment

Supply chain risk was analyzed based on shipping delays and potential financial impact.

### Key Insights

- Most orders fall into **low-risk delivery categories**
- **High-risk deliveries** may lead to significant revenue exposure
- Monte Carlo simulation estimates potential financial losses caused by delivery disruptions

These insights help organizations **manage supply chain risks and optimize logistics planning**.

---

# 💡 Key Business Insights

- Shipping delay is a major indicator of **late delivery risk**
- Sales trends are influenced more by **product demand and seasonal patterns**
- Forecasting models help anticipate **future supply chain demand and operational risks**
